# 11ThPlugins
I am a developer, although it is mostly about Minecraft, I can also take part in your projects. We can discuss the details. If we talk about myself.
I haven't studied university for software, I'm trying to learn it myself, I've been coding Minecraft plugins for 3 years.

__ __I am currently working on java and kotlin and also learning c++ and rust.
